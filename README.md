# Bloom

Bloom is a health and wellness app that was inspired by a form of journaling called Bullet Journaling. Bloom allows you to track different areas in your life that are considered to be integral in maintaining a positive lifestyle. 

Using a log form, you will be able to submit a form for each day. If you get misjudged a day, feel free to edit the log. If you want to completely delete one, that's not an issue - we've built in that feature.

Once you have a few logs, take advantage of the dashboards page which will graphically display each of your logs by day with the hopes of showing you a trend that you may not have noticed. 

# Live Demo
The app is hosted on Heroku: <a href = "https://bloomappthinkful.herokuapp.com">Live Demo</a>
